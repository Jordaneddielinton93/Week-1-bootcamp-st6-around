<h2>Becks Maybury:</h2>

<p> Was able to get a real client to work on their website  

<b>( IT hardware supplier/installer/support company )</b>
 
> I can put this on the form but might be better here:<br><br>
So‚Ä¶..my husband, who was watching tonight and was very impressed by us all, owns an IT hardware supplier/installer/support company.  I was telling him about our group and he‚Äôs asked if we would like to build their website and shop‚Ä¶‚Ä¶?? Needs linking into their trade suppliers‚Äô feeds, payment auth, and also looking for some SEO.<br>
If we fancy a real client, there‚Äôs one here. Obvs I would not be client liaison :laughing:
No stress if it‚Äôs not something we think is a good idea to do üòÅ 

Also giving us a preview of the domain experts current website

<h2>Shola Quadri :</h2>

<p>
  With an honestly Amazing idea from shola to pick projects to go towards a good cause here is his qoute

  >In the spirit of working with real clients, I think it's also a great idea to work with organisations like www.catchafire.org where you get to volunteer technical skills to help non-profit organisations around the world (hundreds of different causes available). <br><br>
I think the benefits would be: <br><br>
Using our skills for "good", also paying it forward (somewhat as School of Code has done for us)
Learning and improving said skills in the process
Less pressure & more freedom to be creative with our solutions as they generally would be more open to new ideas
Gain further experience of working with real life international clients
And finally, it'd be great for everyone's personal brand or PR (especially in mid-long term)
I have this option added to the options on the form, but it's also great to seize this opportunity to expand on my thought process and give you all an insight into the rationale behind my suggestion.

Also Giving great Questions for when we meet up with the domain expert:

>Shola Quadri  5:25 PM
What were the main issues/problems faced with the old website/why does he want to change it?
What are the objectives of the new website?
Who are the end customers/users?
Can we get access to some of them to speak to them, if needed?
What's the budget in place (I.e. I imagine hosting subscription/small enterprise level subscription to ensure secure storage of db would be needed since users information and payment details will be getting put up on the app) --> this potentially will influence the tech stack used
Is there a deadline he's working towards?
Is he looking for just a web app and/or a native mobile solution?
What is the current status of his branding (if any)? Does he want this to be overhauled as well?

And putting his name forward to be product Owner

>Jordan Linton  11:50 AM <br>
@here After a great suggestion by Becki . If anybody wants to put their name forward to be product owner ( talking with the client / link between us and the client).
If you could put your name forward with a reason why then we will vote on Monday :slightly_smiling_face:  giving them Tuesday & Wednesday to prep

And suggesting for the domain expert to meet on our Wednesday meetup

>If we are going with becks client I think we need to have a meeting with him to see what he wants before starting on UX. Do we want to invite him to meeting on Wednesday?

<h2>Jamie Hannah</h2>

<p>
Putting across a good point towards Payment details.

> It‚Äôll be worth checking with Becks‚Äô husband which payment method he‚Äôll want to use (or both), as they have different transaction fees and requirements for the seller. I‚Äôve used both at my work and they handle safety on the customer side really well. No need to ever store customer information

<h1>Product Owner Applications:</h1>

> <h2>Shola Quadri<h2><br>
I'm potentially up for that:
I have the academic training (Masters level) and years of experience in business strategy & marketing, 3 years as a consultant (often leading teams of varied sizes) working with tech start ups and larger companies like P&G to initiate, strategise, execute and deliver projects
I also successfully carried out the same role in our final project #NutriGlow
Finally, given my background in business, I'm interested in blending the two sides of tech and business in the long run, so this would also be a good opportunity to get more experience and taste for it
*to add to this, as evident/demonstrated in previous chat threads on this channel (I.e. Jordan's "what questions should we ask the client"):
I have the experience in asking the right questions to accurately investigate and determine the business needs for companies
If any of you have any questions or would like to know more, you can dm me..
<hr>

> <h2>Amina Afzal</h2>  <br>
Im also up for the Product owner role
Finished a separate bootcamp on product design which included learning how to take a product from start to finish
I have experience talking to clients from freelancing I've been doing
I also have a project template for us to use for the duration of this project, like the hand off and how to present what were doing
Also carried out the same role for Nutriglow, making sure we met our domain experts brief and made sure not to alienate him
alsooooo Ive just started a product owner course with hqpm so would be fun to apply what I'm learning :stuck_out_tongue:
